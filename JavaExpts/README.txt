Java Precisely and its example programs come with no warranty of any
kind, either expressed or implied. In no event shall I or the Royal
Veterinary and Agricultural University or the IT University of
Copenhagen be liable for any damage resulting from its use.

The source code for Example 1 is in file Example1.java, and so on.

Most examples are compiled and ready to run; running them requires
Java Development Kit 1.3 or 1.4.

For instance, to run the program from Example 5, unpack the example
archive and type

   java Example5

Some example programs require additional command line argument; they
will say so if invoked without command line arguments.

The programs Example68 and Example 69 may be run with option -ea or
-enableassertions (under JDK 1.4 or later).
